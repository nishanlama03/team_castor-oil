## **🏗️ Project Overview**

**Describe:**
### **Project Overview**  
 
The Kaggle competition offers Break Through Tech AI Program participants a hands-on opportunity to develop AI models and refine their performance optimization skills.  

While AI is advancing healthcare, dermatology AI models often struggle to accurately diagnose conditions in people with darker skin tones due to a lack of diverse training data. This can lead to misdiagnoses, delayed treatments, and worsening health disparities in underserved communities.  

In partnership with the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL), Break Through Tech challenges participants to build a more inclusive dermatology AI model. Competing teams are evaluated based on a weighted average F1 score, encouraging solutions that improve fairness and accuracy.  

By tackling bias in dermatology AI, this project aims to promote equitable healthcare, reduce diagnostic disparities, and improve outcomes for diverse populations.

## **📊 Data Exploration**

**Describe:**

* The dataset(s) used (i.e., the data provided in Kaggle \+ any additional sources)
* Data exploration and preprocessing approaches
* Challenges and assumptions when working with the dataset(s)

Used Kaggle provided datasets - number of training images =  2860 and test images = 1227.
Encode the labels, split the data into training and validation sets (0.8/0.2 split), define image data generators for training and validation sets.

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Plots, charts, heatmaps, feature visualizations, sample dataset images

---

## **🧠 Model Development**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Model(s) used (e.g., CNN with transfer learning, regression models)
* Feature selection and Hyperparameter tuning strategies
* Training setup (e.g., % of data for training/validation, evaluation metric, baseline performance)

---

## **📈 Results & Key Findings**

**Describe (as applicable):**

* Performance metrics (e.g., Kaggle Leaderboard score, F1-score)
* How your model performed overall
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)
* Insights from evaluating model fairness (AJL)

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**WiDS challenge:**

1. What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?
2. How could your work help contribute to ADHD research and/or clinical care?

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, “Through poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what’s happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.”
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.
Check out [this guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKaVNR\_l7Abx2kebs3AdDi6TlPviC3q/view) from the Algorithmic Justice League for inspiration!

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?
